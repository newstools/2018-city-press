Embattled ANC MP Vincent Smith has asked for permission to step aside from chairing any parliamentary committees until his name has been cleared. This comes after City Press reported on Sunday that Smith was paid at least R670 000 by controversial facilities management group Bosasa over the past three years. In addition, Smith allegedly accepted the installation of electric fences and a high-end CCTV system at his home worth roughly R200 000, and allegedly also received R100 000 in cash from Bosasa chief executive officer Gavin Watson every month. READ: Top ANC MP Vincent Smith got cash, CCTV Smith is co-chair of the constitutional review committee which is looking into the possible amendment of the Constitution to allow for land expropriation without compensation. He was also appointed chair of the justice and correctional services committee last week.Meanwhile, the joint standing committee on financial management of Parliament has elected Mathole Motshekga as one of its co-chairpersons.“Dr Motshekga filled the vacancy that was left by Mr Vincent Smith, who has been redeployed to another parliamentary committee,” it said in a statement.On Tuesday Smith responded for the first time to the allegations against him and said he welcomed “any investigation into my personal loan transaction”.He said he would fully participate in a parliamentary process led by the ethics committee “which I have no doubt will absolve me completely”.This was after the Democratic Alliance reported him to Parliament’s ethics committee.Smith maintained that he entered into a personal loan agreement with former Bosasa chief operating officer Angelo Agrizzi, whom he called a “brother”.In his statement on Tuesday, Smith clarified that the money was for his daughter’s university tuition and that the amounts of R220 000 and R395 000 were to be repayed by him.He, however, vehemently denied that he recieved “any further assistance, financial or otherwise, including the installation of CCTV cameras” which he paid for himself.City Press’ sister publication News24 verified that two payments were made to a company of which Smith is the sole director, Euro Blitz 48, totalling R671 000 in July 2015 and August 2016.One was a cash deposit by a Bosasa employee and the other an EFT by an attorney from funds held in a trust account for Bosasa.In his statement Smith admitted that the loan was processed through the company but said it was “fully declared in the register of members interest and this has been the case since the acquisition of the company”.Smith also said that he would present himself to the ANC’s integrity commission to be held accountable.ANC says Smith targeted because of land expropriationIn a statment released on behalf of the ANC by its Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu, the ruling party said that it was “moved by comrade Smith’s unshakeable, ethical and moral request to step aside as chairperson of the various parliamentary committees he chairs.”The decision whether to remove him as chair, however, will only be made next Wednesday when the ANC caucus meets.Mthembu also questioned the motive and timing of the allegations, saying that the ANC was “convinced that he is a target of the organisations who are vehemently opposed to our people getting access to the land that they were dispossessed from by colonial and apartheid oppressors”.This, Mthembu said, was based on Smith’s recent national and international fame articulating the ANC’s stance on land expropriation without compensation.Praising Smith’s sense of accountablity and transparency, Mthembu said the ANC was “very inspired by the strong sense of integrity and political accountable displayed by comrade Smith. Our confidence in him remains unblemished”.
