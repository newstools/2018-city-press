Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi is expected to visit the Kumalo Primary School in Katlehong after two pupils died at the school on Tuesday. The siblings – a 10-year-old in Grade 4 and a 7-year-old in Grade 1 – both complained about experiencing stomach cramps and feeling nauseous while in their respective classrooms. They were taken to the school’s clinic but were declared dead upon arrival. A psychological unit has been dispatched to the school to provide counselling and Lesufi has also offered pastoral care to the family and the school. “On behalf of the entire education fraternity in Gauteng, we would like to extend our deepest condolences to the family of the deceased learners and wish them peace and comfort in the knowledge that we too share their loss. No words are enough to express our sorrow at the loss of a child,” said Lesufi. An educator who was sent by the school to inform the family about the tragic incident found that another sibling (5) was also complaining of similar symptoms. The 5-year-old is now at the Thelle Mogoerane Hospital in a critical but stable condition. Lesufi has appointed an independent team to establish the cause of death and verify all available statements from the school and the parents. The police are also investigating the incident.
