Former president Jacob Zuma’s personal legal fees bill to be covered by the Presidency now stands at close to R17 million‚ an increase from the R15.3 million previously disclosed in March. The Presidency has confirmed that President Cyril Ramaphosa has written to National Assembly Speaker, Baleka Mbete, to revise the figure. Ramaphosa said that the additional R1.4 million came to light through investigations by the department of justice while preparing documents for litigation. Ramaphosa’s letter to Mbete said that the sum of R16.78 million had been confirmed by director-general in the presidency Cassius Lubisi in an affidavit submitted to the high court. In sending the letter, Ramaphosa was correcting a reply he had given in Parliament in March that the legal costs amounted to R15.3 million. The Democratic Alliance has launched an application to review and set aside the agreements between the presidency and Zuma to cover the legal costs incurred by him for his criminal prosecution. The case will be heard in the High Court in Pretoria on November 6 and November 7. “Over the last decade, Zuma has exploited our justice system with numerous court proceedings that had the intention of avoiding or delaying criminal prosecutions against him. "He has also misused the courts to maintain his grip on power,” DA federal council chairperson James Selfe said Friday. “The taxpayer has so far footed the bulk of the legal bill for this. The DA will not stand by and let this unjust situation continue. “South Africans have already paid too dearly for Zuma’s term in office and should not be required to foot the costs of his legal proceedings. "Zuma should not be entitled to any further financial support from the government or the people of South Africa and the DA looks forward to arguing our case in court,” Selfe said.
