It’s nearly time to celebrate Heritage Day and South Africans have already taken to social media to proudly showcase their heritage and vibrant cultures as the day, also known as National Braai Day, approaches. The Braai Day initiative was started as a celebration of the country’s unique national pastime and aims to unite all South Africans on 24 September. Each year South Africans come together and take part in fun and engaging activities shared by all demographic groups. Here’s what some of the cultural attire is looking like this year:  In the midst of the cultural celebration, President Cyril Ramaphosa called on road users to be vigilant and exercise courtesy as they travel across the country for the Heritage Day weekend. The message comes after a harrowing incident on the N1 in Limpopo on Friday which claimed the lives of 11 people when the bus in which they were travelling overturned. “Heritage Day and our leisure time around it should be an occasion for celebration and for enjoyment; it should not be a time of disaster and mourning,” said the president. “I call on all road users, including pedestrians, to be cautious and courteous on our roads. Anyone who observes unsafe behaviour, should report this to law enforcement agencies so that we can all enjoy our country’s wonderful cultural and natural heritage in safety,” Ramaphosa said.
