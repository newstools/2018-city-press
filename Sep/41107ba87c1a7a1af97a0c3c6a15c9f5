South Africa has officially been plunged into a technical recession, according to figures released by Statistics South Africa on Tuesday. The economy contracted by 0.7% in the second quarter of this year, following on from a 2.6 % contraction in the first quarter of 2018, leading to a technical recession, Stats SA confirmed on Tuesday. “We are in recession. We reported a contraction in the first quarter even with revisions and now in the second quarter with a fall of 0.7%, we are in recession,” Statistician-General Risenga Maluleke said in Pretoria on Tuesday. This is South Africa’s first recession since the 2008/09 global financial crisis. The primary sector has been the hardest hit, which includes agriculture, trade, transport and government. Widespread droughts throughout the country have hit the agricultural sector, resulting in a mammoth 29.2% decline in the second quarter. This was followed by the transport industry with a 4.9% decline and the trade industry with a 1.9% decline. The mining sector, however, saw an increase in production and was up 4.9%. Consumer spending habits have also been adjusted for the first time since 2016, which saw a drop in spending by 1.3%, with Stats SA saying that this matched a decline in the sale of the retail and motor industry sectors for the same period. Electricity consumption, however, increased by 2.1%, despite a 5.23% increase for direct Eskom customers which was approved by The National Energy Regulator of South Africa earlier this year. Exports grew substantially by 13.7% in the second quarter, with a rise in the exports of pearls, precious and semi-precious stones as well as vegetable products.
