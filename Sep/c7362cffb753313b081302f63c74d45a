Irvette van Zyl continues to push boundaries after her back-to-back wins in just 24 hours. The Nedbank runner crossed the finish line in 33.41 minutes at the FNB Joburg 10K City Run on Monday morning at Mary Fitzgerald Square. The 31-year-old beat her rival and defending champion of the Joburg race, Glenrose Xaba. This victory comes after Van Zyl won the 10km Cape Town marathon where she produced a sublime performance in the women’s race, clocking 32.48 minutes for the win. Susy Chebet of Kenya finished second on Monday with a time of 34.30 minutes. Rounding of the top three was South Africa Gherda Steyn with 35.01 minutes. Xaba came in fourth place with 35.10 minutes. “I didn’t think I will win today after yesterday’s race,” Van Zy told the media. “Coming from the Cape Town race to here, there was not much time to prepare. I was bit stiff this morning when I woke up. I made a break at about four km and from there on I was running alone.” She said she was “very happy with my performance of the last 24 hours”. Earlier in the men’s race, Eritrean Filmon Ande crossed the line first with the record time of 29.27 minutes. Mande Bushendich of Uganda came second with 29.37 minutes, while Namakoe Nkasi of Lesotho was third with 29.40 minutes. The only South African at the top was Thabang Masiako fiinish at fouth place.
