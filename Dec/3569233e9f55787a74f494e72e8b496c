Bafana Bafana legend Phil Masinga, who has been admitted to a North West hospital, has allayed fears about his ill-health. Speaking on his behalf, wife Ntombi Nombewu told City Press that the former striker has been taken care of and was in high spirits. Nombewu said Masinga had not been feeling well for the past four months. “It started with stomach cramps and a whole lot of tests were done on him. He has been to private doctors and also to a private hospital here in Klerksdorp and at first they suspected peptic cancer and was treated for that,” said Nombewu from Masinga’s hospital bed at Tshepong Hospital. However, she said, the former Bafana striker did not get any better from the treatment and went for further tests which discovered more medical problems. “I must add that where he is now [Tshepong Hospital], they have been taking good care of him. He has good professionals looking after him and we are happy with his progress. We are not complaining at all and there is no need to rush to private hospitals in Gauteng, as if North West does not have good hospitals. He is happy where he is right now.” READ: Bafana legend Phil Masinga hospitalised Nombewu added that Masinga would go for a biopsy at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital on Friday to do more tests. She said this was because Baragwanath has the equipment needed for the procedure. Masinga also assured his supporters that he was feeling better. The 49-year-old Masinga is best remembered for his 1997 goal against Congo Brazzaville that booked South Africa a spot at its maiden World Cup in France 1998. He played in the English Premier League for Leeds United, and Italian Serie A for Salernitana and Bari. He also played for Jomo Cosmos, Mamelodi Sundowns and St. Gallen in Switzerland.
