Bafana Bafana legend Phil Masinga has been admitted to a North West public hospital with an undisclosed illness. President of the South African Masters and Legend Football Association, Buddha Mathathe confirmed Masinga was admitted to Tshepong Hospital in Klerksdorp. But according to Mathathe, efforts are being made to bring the 49-year-old former striker to a private hospital in Johannesburg. “I just spoke to him now and he is in high spirits. But we are making all the efforts to get him to Johannesburg to get the best medical care. We wish and pray that he gets better,” said Mathathe. Mathathe disclosed that a leading Soweto medical doctor had agreed to place him in one of his private facilities. “We are just waiting for the person to confirm and we will get his doctor’s approval before he [can] be transferred and we are in the process of doing that”. Mathathe said he was saddened by the state of affairs Masinga was in and said that he deserved better. “Chippa [Masinga’s nickname] has done a lot for this country as a footballer. He was a good ambassador for the country and represented us well in England, Switzerland and Italy. Unfortunately, like many other footballers, he was never exposed to financial literacy and now finds himself in a bad financial state. “We might be setting a precedent in helping him out, but we cannot fold our arms and pretend he has not done a lot for the country. He needs our help in this hour of need,” said Mathathe. Masinga is best remembered for his 1997 goal against Congo Brazzaville that booked South Africa a spot at its maiden World Cup in France 1998.  He played in the English Premier League for Leeds United, and Italian Serie A for Salernitana and Bari. He also played for Jomo Cosmos, Mamelodi Sundowns and St. Gallen in Switzerland.
