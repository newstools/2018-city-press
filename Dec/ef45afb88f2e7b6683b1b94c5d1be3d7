Phakamani Dludla’s bravery and perseverance has paid off. The 26-year-old Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) student spent days and nights asking for donations so he could pay off his tuition debt and get his diploma and degree in language practice. An excited Dludla told City Press that he was already armed with his papers after good Samaritans came to his aid. Last Tuesday Dludla paid off the R32 000 he owed the institution in exchange for his certificates. Dludla said he was thrilled to have his qualifications. He had been asking for donations for two weeks. “Sometimes pride doesn’t help you, it just holds you back. I wish people in need would go door to door and ask for help. Do not block your own opportunities by keeping quiet. People are willing to help,” said Dludla. “I am happy. I am grateful to everyone who helped me and even those who criticised me. Those who laughed at me helped me get recognition from the people who wanted to help.” Dludla was not too shy to stand at traffic lights asking for donations from passing motorists, passengers and fellow students. By putting his pride aside and sharing his story he managed to cover his fees. During the day he would sit at a bus terminal at TUT’s North campus and at night he would knock on doors at students’ residences. Begging for donations could soon change the life of the man who hails from Ulundi, KwaZulu-Natal, because he can get a job and support his family. Last week he told City Press he was offered a job to teach English in China but lost out because he did not have his certificates. That’s when he made up his mind to hit the streets cap in hand. He still hopes he will get the job in China. He said he would send the documents to the embassy and his agency. “I have contacted my agent. Now I am busy getting my Teach English as a Foreign Language certificate. “Once I am done with that I will be ready to go to China,” said Dludla.
