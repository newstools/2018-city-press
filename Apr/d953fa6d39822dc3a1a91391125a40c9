The Economic Freedom Fighters is increasing its internal security following claims of “covert” plans to assassinate its leader Julius Malema. The party said a small group in the North West, allegedly related to a motion of no confidence against North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo, was behind the plot. The police minister was alerted to the plan to kill Malema. “The covert plans come from reliable sources who indicate that a small group of politically insecure and insane individuals from the North West province have approached drug dealers and assassins in different provinces, particularly in the Western Cape, to assassinate EFF president,” the EFF said on Tuesday evening. “The ruling party is known for internal political killings to suppress its own members and activists, and it looks like they now intend to export the political killings to other political parties. “The EFF cautions the ruling party and all right wing forces that resorting to violence will degenerate the peace, which came through a very painful and difficult transition period in South Africa,” the statement continued.  The alleged assassination plot came after the EFF called for a secret ballot to unseat Mahumapelo. The party tabled the motion of no confidence against Mahumapelo which was set to be debated on Tuesday, but was postponed to allow for court processes to unfold. Mahumapelo faces numerous allegations of corruption, the latest being over a bursary worth R1.1 million awarded to his son by state aerospace company Denel.
