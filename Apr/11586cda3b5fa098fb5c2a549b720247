State Security Agency director-general Arthur Fraser has been transferred to the department of correctional services, in a move that sees Loyiso Jafta move in the opposite direction and marking his return to intelligence circles. Jafta, a former analyst in the ANC’s department of intelligence and security in the defunct Umkhonto weSizwe military wing, will be acting in the position until the appointment has been finalised. He previously left the intelligence service in 2009 at the same time as the likes of Manala Manzini, Hilton Tim Dennis and Taki Netshitenzhe. He recently served as head in the office of deputy correctional services minister Thabang Makwetla. The move brings to an end Fraser’s 19 month tenure at the helm of the SSA since September 2016, during which he had been accused of purging experienced spies by restructuring the agency in order for his office to gain total control of operations. He had also been accused of corruption, prompting an investigation the office of the inspector general of intelligence. On Thursday the high court in Pretoria was expected to decide whether or not to hear on an urgent basis the application against Fraser by Inspector-General of Intelligence, Setlhomamaru Dintwe, in which he complained that Fraser unfairly withdrew his security clearance to block his office from probing the allegations against him. A lack of security clearance prevented Dintwe from access to classified state information and premises. SSA spokesperson Brian Dube said on Tuesday in a statement that State Security Minister Dipuo Letsatsi-Duba and President Cyril Ramaphosa agreed after consultation to transfer Fraser and he had also accepted the decision. “The transfer has been agreed upon with Mr Fraser and will be effective immediately,” Dube said.
