Soweto Theatre alongside The Market theatre presents the Gibson Kente Musical Tribute commemorating Kente’s life and works. Photographer Rosetta Msimang captured this week’s show at The Market, which coincided with the 55th anniversary of when Gibson Kente produced his first play, Manana, The Jazz Prophet, which featured celebrated musicians Caiphus Semenya and Letta Mbulu. The musical is choreographed by Douglas Sekete and directed by Johan Mthethwa. Kente was known as the father of township theatre. His works drew on township culture, slang, fashion and topical issues of the day. He discovered and mentored people – who rose to become some of the country’s most famous artists and entertainers – from his garage in Dube, Soweto. Some of his star pupils included Brenda Fassie, Nomsa Nene and Mbongeni Ngema. He also wrote music for artists such as Mbulu and Miriam Makeba. He died in 2004. The show ends on Sunday, April 29.
