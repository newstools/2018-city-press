Struggle icon Winnie Madikizela-Mandela was laid to rest yesterday at Fourways Memorial Park, next to two of her great-grandchildren. The funeral service was held at Orlando Stadium, about a kilometre away from her house in Soweto. The mourners were addressed by Madikizela-Mandela’s daughters Zenani Mandela-Dlamini and Zindzi Mandela, President Cyril Ramaphosa and Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema. Former presidents Jacob Zuma, Thabo Mbeki and Kgalema Motlanthe were also in attendance. Thousands of ordinary citizens came from far and wide to pay their final respects. Among them was 78-year-old Lilly Tsamai from Mahikeng, North West, who said she met Madikizela-Mandela at Park Lane Clinic in Johannesburg in the 1990s. “She smiled when I shook her hand. I had to come and pay my last respects. Winnie was everything to me. She and her ex-husband did a lot for us.” George Lefading (36) from Soweto, Gauteng, said although he had never met Madikizela-Mandela, he felt obliged to go to her funeral. “She contributed to the development of the people in this country. It is up to us to take over and do what she fought for.” Tsakane Shibambo (38) said he and 50 other people were bussed in from Mahwelereng, Limpopo. They left Mahwelereng on Friday night and arrived in Soweto at 2.30am yesterday. He said: “We loved the Mother of the Nation. She was the most beautiful woman in the world.” – Tebogo Letsie, Rosetta Msimango, Mpumelelo Buthelezi and Msindisi Fengu
