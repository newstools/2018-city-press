Convicted racist Vicki Momberg returned to the Randburg Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday morning to apply for leave to appeal her sentence after spending her first week behind bars. Momberg, who walked back to the dock sporting a new hairdo – cornrows, made a brief appearance as her legal team requested a postponement of her leave to appeal application, stating that her advocate, Kevin Lawlor, had been hospitalised. This came a week after Magistrate Pravina Rugoonandan sentenced Momberg to an effective three years in prison with one year suspended for using the K-word against police officers during a 2016 racist tirade after a smash-and-grab accident in Johannesburg. She was denied bail last week, and remained in jail until Wednesday morning’s application for leave to appeal. In her brief appearance at the Randburg court, Momberg’s legal team also credited the postponement to their request for the recordings of the 10111 calls, in which Momberg was convicted of using the K-word. Momberg’s legal team requested a postponement until April 11, until which time Momberg was expected to remain behind bars.
