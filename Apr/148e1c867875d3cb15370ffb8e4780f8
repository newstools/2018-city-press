We may not have seen much of her on TV lately, but Lira has been pounding the stages on her #BeaboutItTour for her last album Born Free. The album, she says, pays homage to Winnie Madikizela-Mandela “and her contribution towards the freedom of the nation”. Lira is also in the studio finalising her seventh studio album. She says she is working “with three Grammy Award-winning producers”. Fans of hers who would like to see her in action before her performance early next month at Krugersdorp’s Silverstar Casino can catch her in Starlight Classics on M-Net next Sunday. Accompanied by the Cape Town Philharmonic Orchestra, Lira will be sharing a stage with 24-year-old operatic soprano Cecilia Rangwanasha from Lebowakgomo, Limpopo. Rangwanasha said she’d “never performed for so many people”. “I grew up in Limpopo; we knew nothing about classical music,” she says. “I didn’t want to grow up and be an opera singer; I wanted to be a lawyer. It was my late mother who encouraged me to study music. I didn’t think I could make a living out of singing opera and the South African market isn’t very big. So it was a risk I took and I’m glad I did.” .  Catch Starlight Classics: In Concert With RMB on Sunday, April 29, at 4.30pm on M-Net, DStv channel 101.
