As the 2019 national elections near the horizon, the ANC is steamrolling its campaign under the theme “unity and renewal”. The ANC’s head of elections, Fikile Mbalula, addressed the media in the Western Cape on Monday, outlining the party’s plan to try and win back control of the province ahead of the 2019 elections. Former Western Cape premier Ebrahim Rasool was announced as the provincial elections head for the Western Cape.  “I’m not doing this reluctantly. If ever the moment was there for the ANC to be ready for this province, it is now,” Rasool said. “A comrade has spoken about the so-called ‘Ramaphoria’, the excitement that is there, the clean-up that is going on, the putting [of] the past behind us, the vision to the future … the enthusiasm that is making the opposition almost unemployed … all of that is in place ... The ANC’s renewal comes at the same time as the DA is imploding. For those who left the ANC, come back. We are calling you for the campaign of your life. “[This is] an ANC we are proud of and an ANC that we want to represent, and an ANC that we want to win,” Rasool said. Mbalula added that when Rasool was premier in the province, there was a focus on the poor unlike with the DA leadership. The DA, also the national opposition party, has been heading up the provincial government since the 2009 elections.
