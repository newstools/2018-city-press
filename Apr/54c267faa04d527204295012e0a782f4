The case against prominent businessman Hlumelo Biko, who allegedly assaulted his wife, has been postponed. Biko appeared at the Cape Town Magistrates’ Court this morning on charges of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, after his case was postponed in February this year. He was released with a warning. Biko has been accused by his wife of two years, 27-year-old Sandisiwe Magqaza, of assaulting her after the couple had an argument. Magqaza opened a case of domestic violence at the Camp’s Bay police station on New Year’s Day, following the alleged incident. Until now, Biko has pleaded not guilty to the charges. He made his first appearance in court on January 4. The case was postponed to February 27, when he appeared briefly. It is alleged that the incident involved Biko and Magqaza arguing before Biko demanded “his” wedding ring from her. During the argument, Biko allegedly assaulted his wife. Attorney Roy Barendse, who is representing Biko, has previously said that Biko denied the allegations. In January, he said: “We know that certain allegations have been made against him and his family. We will deal with those allegations when the appropriate time arrives.” Biko is the son of the late Black Consciousness leader Steve Biko, and former World Bank managing director Mamphela Ramphele.
