South African jazz musician Wanda Baloyi shared the stage with soul and gospel singer Oleta Adams for a one-night musical extravaganza at the Sandton Convention centre. Their performance was part of many activities which are done before the main Standard Bank Joy of Jazz festival which is usually held in September. Wanda Baloyi celebrated the life and music of bra Hugh Masekela in song while Oleta Adams, who arrived in South Africa last week, opened her performance with ‘Feeling Good’ originally sung by Nina Simone. Wanda later joined Adams on stage pulling off an outstanding performance singing ‘Don’t let the sun go down on me’. The Road to Joy of Jazz performance paved the way to the highly anticipated line-up announcement scheduled for next month.
