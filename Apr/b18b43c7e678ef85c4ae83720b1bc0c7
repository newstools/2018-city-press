Jacob Zuma’s controversial son, Edward, was among the former president’s supporters who gathered in Durban on Thursday ahead of his long-awaited court appearance on Friday. He was also proudly wearing his ANC colours, and the ANC flag was displayed prominently, in defiance of a decree by the ANC national executive committee that such displays of support for accused people should not be done under the ANC banner. Durban University of Technology students chanted and sang on Thursday as they prepared to march to Albert Park where a night vigil would be held. Albert Park is within walking distance of the KwaZulu-Natal High Court, where Zuma will face 16 charges relating to 783 payments that he is alleged to have received in connection with the controversial multibillion-rand arms deal. The charges were dropped in 2009. However, embattled National Prosecuting Authority boss Shaun Abrahams announced on March 16 that the charges against Zuma would be reinstated. He said Zuma would be prosecuted for one count of racketeering, two counts of corruption, one count of money laundering and 12 counts of fraud. Abrahams said he was of the view that there were reasonable prospects of a successful prosecution of Zuma. Representatives from arms deal manufacturer Thint are expected to appear alongside Zuma on Friday. On Thursday Edward Zuma o vowed to wear his ANC colours to court to support his father, in defiance of a party directive and a warning from Police Minister Bheki Cele, TimesLive reported. Addressing reporters after an ANC national executive committee meeting recently, ANC secretary general Ace Magashule said that while anyone was free to show their support for party members accused of corruption, they should not do so under the banner of the ANC.
