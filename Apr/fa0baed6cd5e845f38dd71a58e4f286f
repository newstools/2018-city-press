The presidency has announced the names of those who will receive national orders by President Cyril Ramaphosa later this month. Chancellor of the national orders, Dr Cassius Lubisi, said that the orders “are the highest awards that our country bestows on our citizens and eminent foreign nationals who have contributed to the advancement of democracy, and who have made a significant impact on improving the lives of South Africans.” The list of 40 honorees includes former deputy chief justice Dikgang Moseneke, anti-apartheid activist Zondeni Sobukwe and Professor Farid Esack, head of the religious study department at the University of Johannesburg. They will each receive the Order of Luthuli in gold, silver and bronze, respectively. The Order of Luthuli recognises South African citizens who have contributed to the struggle for democracy, nation-building, building democracy and human rights, justice and peace as well as for the resolution of conflict. Those citizens who have contributed to community service, business and economy, science, medicine and technological innovation will be awarded the Order of the Baobab, while those in the field of arts, culture, literature, music, journalism and sport are awarded the Order of Ikhamanga. Eminent foreign nationals who have shown friendship to South Africa are also recognised under the Order of the Companions of OR Tambo. On this list are the former president of Liberia and Africa’s first female head of state, Ellen Sirleaf, as well as the former president of Mozambique Joaquim Chissano and the first president of Namibia, Samuel Nujoma. The 24th investiture ceremony will be held on Saturday April 28. See below for the full list of honourees: Full list of South Africa's 2018 National Order recipients by CityPress on Scribd
