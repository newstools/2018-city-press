The Democratic Alliance has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to act in the interest of all communities and remove “Zuma’s protégé”, North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo. The party says that it is unacceptable that Mahumapelo still holds his position following Ramaphosa’s visit to the embattled province last week, adding that the president’s visit was merely for show. “The fact that Mahumapelo remains in office signals that Ramaphosa’s cancellation of business and the United Kingdom was nothing more than a PR stunt. “We note that Ramaphosa will jet off to the Republic of Angola on Tuesday while Mahumapelo remains in office and the North West burns,” the party said on Monday. Parts of the province were engulfed in a wave of violent protests last week following numerous calls for service delivery and the removal of Mahumapelo. The DA condemned the violence and said that the protests in Mahikeng signalled the “frustration [arising] from a failure of leadership and governance at all levels”. The ANC leadership feared a bloodbath in the province if they had removed Mahumapelo, a source told City Press. “There would have been mayhem here in Mahikeng had he [Mahumapelo] been fired. Innocent people were going to die so Cyril did well,” a North West ANC official said. The aftermath of the protests has reportedly seen at least 23 people appearing at the Mmabatho Magistrates’ Court for their alleged involvement in the demonstrations. Charges include public violence and malicious damage to property. The ANC’s top six is currently meeting in Durban for more discussions, with Ramaphosa promising residents that the party will address their concerns. Meanwhile, the police continue maintaining their presence in the area, monitoring the situation, until the talks come to an end. National defence force medics have also been deployed to assist at hospitals and clinics crippled by a strike in the health sector.
