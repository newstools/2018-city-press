Gautrain employees who are members of the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) have issued a warning to commuters ahead of their strike on Friday that the trains will not be 100% safe. Numsa employees work as maintainers of the trains and according to a worker, who asked to remain anonymous, the maintainers have tampered with some of the safety aspects of the trains. Mduduzi Nkosi, Numsa’s national sector coordinator, said that it would be unsafe for the trains to operate as they require daily maintenance which only their maintainers can do. “The maintainers are responsible for the entire management and signalling systems, as well as servicing of the trains. They also have to certify daily that the trains are safe to use. Other maintainers won’t be qualified and have the experience of our workers if they [outsource] it,” Nkosi said. Nkosi said the strike was brought about by various demands, which were heard by the CCMA on May 10, after Gautrain management refused to grant them. On their list of grievances, Numsa workers demand: • Equal work for equal pay • Housing allowance (which Nkosi says is granted to other company employees associated with Gautrain) • A 13th cheque • Transport allowance • Overtime pay for weekend labour According to Nkosi, the CCMA issued the workers with a certificate to strike after talks with management failed to bring about an agreement. He said that the strike would be indefinite until their demands are met. The strike is set for Friday at the Midrand Gautrain Depot. Gautrain spokesperson Kesagee Nayager said they have contingency plans for the strike. “We have contingency plans in place to ensure that the train service is not adversely affected. We will not compromise on safety and the necessary maintenance works will be conducted to ensure that we continue to operate a safe and efficient service. We remain open to reaching an amicable agreement.”
