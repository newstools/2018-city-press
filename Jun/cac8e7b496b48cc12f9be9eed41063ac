King Mswati III always stuns his people – and the world. He was dripping in cash when he celebrated his 50th birthday in the Mandvulo Grand Hall at Lozitha Royal Palace two months ago. At the garden party, he wore a royal blue jacket sparkling with diamonds – the weight of which was believed to be more than 5kg. On his right wrist, he wore a glittering watch believed to have been manufactured by US jeweller Jacob & Co. It was estimated to be worth $1.6 million (R21 million). The king was joined by visiting Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen. Immediately after the festivities, a local chat group known as Umgosi eSwatini was lit up with people registering their dismay about the way money was being misused in their country. The Nation, a local monthly magazine, was the only publication that questioned why Swazi people were taken for granted and why their resources were used by the royal family. Its editor, Bheki Makhubu, wrote that he would rather spend time behind bars than keep quiet when the country’s resources were being squandered by the royal family. Meanwhile, Queen Mother Ntfombi Tfwala presented her son, Mswati, with a dining room suite “made of gold and decorated with precious stones sourced from the sea”, according to palace sources.The lavish present was accompanied by other gifts, including a herd of 344 cattle and 15 million Swazi lilangeni (R15m in cash). These were bestowed on the king ahead of the country’s golden jubilee celebrations in April.Mswati said he would be pleased if other donors could raise about 100 million lilangeni to show that the country’s economy was strong.
