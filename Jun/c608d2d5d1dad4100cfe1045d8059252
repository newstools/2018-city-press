Over a period of several years, Botswana born photographer Letso Leipego has photographed all his subjects in their own environments, usually rural settings, both at home and at work. He recently completed the Artist Boot Camp at the Bag Factory in Fordsburg. His work will show as a solo exhibition at the Guns & Rain gallery in Parkhurst in August 2018. Letso Leipego’s photography of rural life in Botswana is inspired by curiosity – something he says he inherited from his grandfather. Leipego “makes pictures that call attention to things that the observer tends to overlook”. His interest in light and darkness extends to a curiosity about people living beyond mainstream urban society, whose stories and histories are seldom illuminated with the same intensity as in his striking photographs.
