Former acting national police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane appeared in the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Pretoria on Thursday morning alongside his wife, Beauty, and car dealer Durant Snyman. Phahlane, who looked calm in court this morning, was charged with fraud, corruption and money laundering alongside his wife and Snyman. This, after he allegedly received vehicles as kickbacks in return for awarding lucrative tenders to a company that supplied consumables to the policeâ€™s forensics division while he was in charge of it. The three were released on R10 000 bail each after their appearance on Thursday morning. The allegations are that Phahlane and his wife received bribes from Snyman to the value of R900 000. All three of the accused face six counts of corruption. It has been a long road to this point for police watchdog Ipid, who battled to investigate the case after Phahlane allegedly opened counter investigations into the Ipid staff probing him.
