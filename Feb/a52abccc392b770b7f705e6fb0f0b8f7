Cosatu has called for the ANC to institute disciplinary action against President Jacob Zuma, whom it says is drunk with power. This is despite the ANC saying he has done nothing wrong. In a harshly worded statement responding to the ANC national executive committee’s decision to recall Zuma, and his subsequent refusal to go without a fight, the ANC’s alliance partner says Zuma must be charged for bringing the party into disrepute. “The federation is not at all surprised by this level of intransigence and total inebriation with power by President Jacob Zuma. This, after all, is the president who, working with his mercenary followers, converted his Cabinet into a rent-seeking, docile and unaccountable caste,” the statement reads. Cosatu has repeatedly called for Zuma to be recalled along with members of his Cabinet who are part of the dead wood. On Monday night, ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa and secretary-general Ace Magashule delivered the recall decision to Zuma following a marathon meeting of the national executive committee. It’s understood that Zuma rejected the offer for him to voluntarily step down. Magashule told the media today that the decision was not unanimous but that members were bound by the collective decision. “He divided and humiliated the ANC on a number of occasions and weakened and almost dismantled the Alliance. The ANC under his leadership behaved like a fanatical cult,” said Cosatu. Cosatu’s president Sdumo Dlamini – a Zuma loyalist – and its second deputy president Zingiswa Losi are both members of the national executive committee, which is the highest decision-making body of the ANC between conferences. “Cosatu also urges the ANC to explore the possibility of charging President Zuma and subjecting him to a disciplinary process for defying a constitutional structure of the ANC and bringing the organisation into disrepute.”
