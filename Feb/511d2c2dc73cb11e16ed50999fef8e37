Stunned police officers are still combing through the crime scene at the Ngcobo police station where five officers were shot and killed by unknown gunmen on Tuesday night. Traumatised police officers said that the attackers separated the men and the women – locking the women into a room and killing the men. Five policemen – four constables and a warrant officer – were killed. A retired soldier was caught in the crossfire and also died. According to police spokesperson, Captain Khaya Thonjeni, the attackers stormed the police station and started firing. “The incident took place after 11pm last night. Inside the police station there were 10 officers – five women and five men. The police women were locked in a room by the suspects and the male officers were all shot and killed brutally. The criminals made off with 10 guns, six pistols, two R5 rifles and two shot guns, including many rounds of ammunition,” Thonjeni said. He said police were working around the clock to apprehend the perpetrators and called on the community to come forward with any information. Thonjeni said different police units have been deployed to Ngcobo in a bid to get to the bottom of the situation. Thonjeni said at least two female officers were treated at hospital and discharged. Police Minister Fikile Mbalula and national police commissioner Kehla Sithole were expected to visit the police station today. Thonjeni also confirmed that a nearby ATM was bombed after the attack at the police station. “Those who were here last night say this was like a war zone with the sound of rifles heard all over town. This is the worst attack we have seen on police in this area. It looks more than just an ordinary attack. It looks like a well-coordinated attack because just after they hit the police station they went on to bomb an ATM,” Thonjeni said.
