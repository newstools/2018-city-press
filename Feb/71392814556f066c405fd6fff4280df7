It’s been good news for communities affected by the drought – not only has “day zero” been pushed back to June, but the drought affecting the southern and western areas of South Africa has finally been declared a national disaster. This will allow national structures to coordinate emergency funding. Day zero, the day that taps will run dry for residents, for Capetonians has now been extended to June 4 from May 11. The latest data from the City of Cape Town indicated that dam storage level was at 24.9%. This is a weekly decrease of -0.6%. The week’s average daily production of all water sources was at 526Ml/day. This is above the target of 450Ml. Meanwhile, according to the statement released by the department of cooperative governance and traditional affairs, the government will “strengthen and support the disaster management structures to implement contingency plans and ensure that immediate relief, recovery and reconstruction measures are put in place to enable the national executive to effectively deal with the effects of this disaster”. The three provinces – the Northern Cape, Western Cape and Eastern Cape – have already been declared provincial disasters. – News24
