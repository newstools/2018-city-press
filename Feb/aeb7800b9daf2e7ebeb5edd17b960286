Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane says that the state of the nation address should reflect what South Africans are most concerned about. “We’re here saying the issues in South Africa are not just about an individual. There is a system that blocks people, due to corruption. There is, in fact, a high level of joblessness that our people are feeling,” he said. Maimane was delivering the party’s “alternative” state of the nation address on Tuesday in Alexandra, Johannesburg, saying he wanted to ensure that the citizens who felt “left behind” in South Africa’s democracy are included in the address. The address comes after Maimane’s travels across the country over the past few weeks “learning firsthand the daily challenges faced by communities”. He was joined by Gauteng provincial leader, John Moodey and Johannesburg mayor, Herman Mashaba.

National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete announced on Tuesday afternoon that the address would no longer take place on Thursday due to the “little likelihood of an uneventful joint sitting”.   “We cannot waste money, time, nor another iota of our dwindling credibility on the international stage by allowing Jacob Zuma to deliver the state of the nation address. “The ANC is in complete turmoil and being held to ransom by Jacob Zuma. One thing we cannot postpone is removing Jacob Zuma and electing a new president. This must be done in the next week. “We flatly reject any amnesty agreement or special deal for Jacob Zuma. He is not above the law, and must still face the 783 charges of fraud, money laundering and racketeering against him which were erroneously dropped almost a decade ago,” the DA said in a statement.
