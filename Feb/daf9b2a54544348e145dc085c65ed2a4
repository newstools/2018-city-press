The red carpet, a ceremonial parade, a national salute – Parliament has assured the public that this evening’s state of the nation address, which is to be delivered by newly elected President Cyril Ramaphosa at 7pm, will happen in its usual splendour. The address was originally scheduled to take place on February 9, but National Assembly speaker Baleka Mbete informed the media at the steps of Parliament that it had been postponed. Jacob Zuma resigned on Wednesday, and the fifth president of the country was sworn in on Thursday. Despite the fast pace at which things moved this week, all plans are in place to ensure a smooth delivery of the most important speech for the year by the nation’s president. “It will involve a ceremonial parade exhibiting military traditions, drills and ethos of the army, the navy and the air force of the Republic of South Africa. This includes a national salute by the ceremonial guard of the South African National Defence Force, a military band, a salute flight by the South African Air Force and a 21-gun salute,” Parliament said yesterday. A total of 1120 guests have been invited. Invited guests include members of the youth, women, members of Chapter 9 institutions, international organisations, heads of Foreign Mission, representatives of the House of Traditional Leaders, , representatives from business and trade organisations, trade union federations, civil society organisations, academic and research institutions and state-owned enterprises and Mayor of Cape Town Patricia de Lille De Lille survived a motion of no confidence by one vote on Thursday in the Cape Town city council and remains the mayor of Cape Town.
