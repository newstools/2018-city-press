The alleged racist attack on 5000m star Thabang Mosiako has been condemned by the Economic Freedom Fighters, who have called on the police to bring the attackers to justice. Last weekend, the 22-year-old Boston College student was attacked and severely beaten just outside one of the North West University campuses in Potchefstroom, in what his friend has labelled a racially motivated attack. Mosiako was set to jet off to Algeria next month to take part in the African Championships, but it now looks unlikely that he will be able to take part. The university said it was working closely with the police to identify the group of young men who allegedly assaulted Mosiako and Rantso Mokopane. The Star newspaper reported that the attack occurred after Mokopane called out the men for swearing at a cashier. The university’s Louis Jacobs says that action would be taken if the group of men were found to be students. “We call on the South African police to do a thorough investigation and bring these men to justice,” the EFF’s Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said on Monday. “It is very clear that the phenomenon of racist attacks by white Afrikaner men is common in small towns like Potchefstroom. It is well known that they go around beating black people and do so at times in the presence of police, with impunity.” Over the weekend, police said the attack was one of numerous fights that occurred during the university’s Raising and Giving activities. Ndlozi called on black people to stand together and make sure these attacks didn’t continue. “We call on black communities to form people’s policing forums to ensure that they hunt and bring these racists to book,” he said. “All black people, particularly students of the surrounding colleges and universities in Potchefstroom must unite against white racism by constituting policing forums to police anti-black racism. “No white man must lay a hand on black people anywhere and not meet the consequences of his brutal action,” Ndlozi said. – News24
