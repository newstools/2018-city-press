Limpopo health MEC Poppy Ramathuba is under fire after she made derogatory remarks about emergency personnel in the province. Ramathuba upset the National Public Service Workers’ Union when she compared emergency medical services (EMS) staff in Limpopo with hydrocephalus patients, who have physically large heads because of extra fluids in the brain. Ramathuba made the comments on Capricorn FM. She also claimed the EMS staff in the province were not qualified. City Press has a copy of the recording. Ramathuba claimed EMS staff in Limpopo attended only a three-week course, so they couldn’t save lives. “In terms of the EMS … let me simplify it to the people of Limpopo: if you get an accident, the ambulances can arrive without a person who can save your life during that golden hour. [A] three-week course [and] they are in the system. They have no science, haven’t done maths, these people today will tell you that they can’t do sh*ts work because they aren’t health professionals in their nature,’’ Ramathuba said. This upset the union’s senior labour officer Rasimati Chabalala, who labelled the MEC’s utterances as “reckless and absolute nonsense”, calling for Limpopo premier Stan Mathabatha to dismiss Ramathuba. “She has damaged the image of the EMS staff in the eyes of the public. She has refused to apologise. We are surprised the premier has not taken any decision to discipline and remove her from his cabinet. “Ramathuba has undermined the union professional body that also certified her as a medical doctor. She has no respect for the patients who are also suffering from hydrocephalus conditions, as well as their families,’’ Chabalala said. Ramathuba told City Press: “I have dealt with this matter before. I have no problem with EMS. My interest is to ensure that things run smoothly in the department of health.”
