The 2018 state of the nation address, which was meant to take place on Thursday, has been postponed. The shocking announcement came after National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete and senior members of Parliament engaged in talks on Tuesday afternoon. “Given the threat of disruption, a postponement was requested by Parliament’s presiding officers of the President of the Republic of South Africa,” Mbete said. She said that they were writing to President Jacob Zuma to request a postponement after the threats of disruption surfaced. “We have regrettably come to the conclusion that there is little likelihood of an uneventful joint sitting of Parliament this coming Thursday. With this in mind, we decided to approach the president of the republic to propose that we postpone the joint sitting in order to create room for establishing a much more conducive political atmosphere in Parliament,” Mbete said. “We met the president today and he was already writing to us asking to postpone. We want a conducive political environment,” she said. They are still waiting for the letter. It is still unclear when the address will take place, Thandi Modise, chairperson of the National Council of Provinces, said they were hoping the postponement would not be longer than a week. Mbete assured the public that the 2018 budget speech would still go ahead.
