Former state president Jacob Zuma appeared to be in good spirits at a farewell cocktail dinner in his honour. Hosted by president Cyril Ramaphosa, the dinner at Tuynhuys in Cape Town was in honour of the former statesman “for his contribution to South Africa’s development during his nine years in office,” the Presidency said. Ramaphosa organised the private event, which was attended by ministers, deputy ministers and officials from the Presidency. Zuma appeared to be in good spirits, contrary to the disgruntled man who addressed the nation last week in an exclusive SABC interview, calling for his party to tell him why he should leave the presidency. Zuma resigned on February 14, a day before he was due to face a motion of no confidence. Ramaphosa was elected as South Africa’s fifth president the following day and was duly sworn in later the same day.
