Opposition parties have reacted to former president Jacob Zuma’s resignation with a resounding sense of relief and welcomed his “overdue” departure. However, the parties called for more heads to roll now that Zuma has vacated office. Zuma’s resignation came after lengthy negotiations with his then deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa and the ANC’s national executive committee. “After getting rid of Zuma, the ANC must show serious intent to rid itself of other corrupt individuals, like [David] Mabuza, Ace Magashule, Pule Mabe and many others,” the Democratic Alliance (DA) said in a statement. United Democratic Movement leader Bantu Holomisa took to social media to express his thoughts. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) chief whip Floyd Shivambu also had a word or two to say. HE’S GONE!! GOOD RIDDANCE! Former DA spokesperson Phumzile van Damme, who recently resigned as the party’s spokesperson, and DA chief whip John Steenhuisen also expressed their views on Twitter. Glad to see the back of JZ, but let’s not forget he has not acted alone. Every step of the way he has been aided and abetted by those very people on the ANC benches now disowning him who assisted him and defended him every step of the way. “We’ll meet somewhere”, Zuma’s final words as he exits the press conference. Well yes, in court then jail. The EFF released a statement saying it would host a media briefing on Thursday midday in response to Zuma’s resignation. ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to be sworn in this afternoon as the fifth president of a democratic South Africa.
