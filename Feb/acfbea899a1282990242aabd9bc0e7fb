The South African Human Rights Commission has met with the National Prosecution Authority (NPA) and the police to discuss a complaint lodged by the family of murdered Eskom employee Thembisile Yende. Yende’s family expressed concern on the slow progress in her murder case saying that they have questioned what they said was a lack of progress in her case. Yende’s body was found at Eskom’s offices in Springs on the East Rand in May last year, about a week after she was reported missing.

The Yende family was shocked by the court’s decision to grant bail to Ngwenya in December last year, claiming that they were not told about his bail application. Speaking to Power FM on Monday, family spokesperson Mboneni Yende said that they were disappointed in the police for their lack of urgency in the matter. “We are concerned about the postponement of the court case. We find it strange that the police have claimed that they have no further leads in the commitment of the crime. “We don’t think a stranger committed the murder, but someone who works at the power utility,” he said Last month the NPA said that the murder case had been postponed to April 18 “for further investigation.”
