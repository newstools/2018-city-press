Protesters from opposing groups, #ZumaMustGo and #HandsOffZuma, gathered on Monday outside Luthuli House, following the Black First Land First’s announcement that they would lead a hands-off-Zuma protest. Protesting members of the ANC, who wanted Jacob Zuma to step down as president, booed ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule, who had come to receive a memorandum from the protesters. They called him a sellout and tried to prevent him from returning to Luthuli House after he had received the memorandum. Photographer Rosetta Msimango took these images:
