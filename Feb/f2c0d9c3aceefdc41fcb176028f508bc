Work is stressing us out. The annual Profmed Stress Index showed that, of the 3 000 graduate professionals who took part in the survey, 45.5% named work as their biggest source of stress, along with financial stress a very close second. The two stressors – work and finances – work hand in hand, affecting respondents’ lives, the survey found. The index also found that when it comes to coping with stress – exercise is the winner. In the 2016 survey 37.6% of respondents said they exercised to manage stress, this year that percentage was up to 41.67%. Of those who took part, the majority of respondents were between 25 and 34, with the next biggest group being 35 to 44. The most represented industry was the medical sector, accounting for 42.04% of respondents. Almost two-thirds of respondents believed they were managing their stress well; 29.15% said they weren’t. This is a concern, said Profmed, as it is an increase on the previous year’s result, which was 28.3%. The reason for the change could be inflation and financial pressures, poor financial planning or debt management, or lifestyle choices that don’t promote good general health.
