The National African Federated Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Nafcoc) conference has elected its former chief executive Sabelo Macingwane as its new president. Macingwane pipped National African Farmers’ Union (Nafu) president, Motsepe Matlala, for the top spot during a rerun of the presidential seat on Wednesday morning at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre, in Durban. Macingwane, who was backed by the Nafcoc Youth Chamber ahead of his election, is meant to give his inaugural speech later today closing the curtain on the two-day conference.  The election process lasted well into the early hours of Wednesday morning at the Protea Hotel Edward, but the presidential seat was deadlocked on votes and there was a rerun this morning where Macingwane replaced Lawrence Mavundla - who has been at the helm for almost a decade.
