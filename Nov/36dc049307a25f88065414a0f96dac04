Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Wiseman Meyiwa’s career could be in serious jeopardy following a horrific motor vehicle accident yesterday. The 18-year-old was admitted to the Union Hospital in Alberton after sustaining back injuries in the accident. A witness, who works for an ambulance services and who was at the scene of the accident accident, told City Press that Meyiwa was in serious distress. The witness alleged the player lost control of the VW Polo GTI about 14km outside Villiers on the N3 in the Free State. “It looked like he was flung out of the car after it hit a ditch and lost control. From our initial assessment he injured his back badly,” said the paramedic, who did not want to be identified. Chiefs spokesperson Vina Maphosa confirmed the accident, but said the details were still too sketchy. However, the club said on Twitter that Meyiwa was taken to intensive care for monitoring. Meyiwa broke into prominence after his promotion from the MultiChoice Diski Challenge to the AmaKhosi senior team by former coach Steve Komphela at the start of last season. The central midfielder has played two matches so far this season – against Free State and SuperSport in the MTN8 – and he is yet to feature in the league. Meyiwa, who hails from Pietermaritxburg, was an unused substitute in Chiefs’ opening five Absa Premiership matches but he has not been part of the AmaKhosi match day squads thereafter, including last weekend’s Soweto derby against Orlando Pirates. The teenager has also attracted the attention of national team selectors and has represented South Africa at two Fifa World Cups with the Under-17 and the Under-20s. Last month, another Chiefs player, Lebogang Manyama, survived an accident while on his way home from training.
