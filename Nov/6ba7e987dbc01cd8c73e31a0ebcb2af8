The Limpopo provincial government has announced its intention to suspend its spokesperson, Phuti Seloba. This stems from allegations by EFF Limpopo chairperson Jossey Buthane that Seloba had told him that Limpopo premier Stan Mathabatha misses vital meetings because he is always drunk; that at one stage Mathabatha forced a trip overseas because he wanted to spend time with Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba and that some MECs awarded tenders to their husbands. Mathabatha’s spokesperson Kenny Mathivha said the Limpopo provincial government had been made aware of serious allegations made against Seloba in the past few days. “In view of the seriousness of these allegations, Mr Seloba has been given an opportunity to make representations as to why he should not be suspended pending investigations on these allegations against him,” Mathivha said. He said Seloba has been given an opportunity to respond to these allegations by Monday.
