Axed South African Revenue Service commissioner Tom Moyane has applied to the North Gauteng High Court to interdict President Cyril Ramaphosa on three counts related to the tax agency. Moyane wants a high court judge to halt Ramaphosa from: Moyane, according to a 43-page court application, also wants the court to reinstatement him as Sars commissioner. In addition, Moyane wants the head of the Sars commission, retired judge Robert Nugent, as well as two of his assistants and head of the disciplinary inquiry that Ramaphosa set up, Advocate Azhar Bham, from issuing any additional interim or final reports or recommendations. He also wants the disciplinary inquiry headed by Bham to remain in place. Moyane wants this application to be heard on November 27 or sooner. The former Sars head was axed by Ramaphosa on November 1. The move to fire Moyane was because the president had accepted Nugent’s recommendation that he be removed. The Sars commission report states that Moyane’s tenure was characterised by "reckless" mismanagement and he "ought not be permitted to continue".
