President Cyril Ramaphosa will be in the hot seat today as he replies to questions in the National Assembly on topics such as the trade agreements with China and government’s economic stimulus package. Originally scheduled to take place last month, the question and answer session was rescheduled after the president fell ill. Ramaphosa has been on an economic drive since his appointment in February, and has been hard at work securing investment deals from across the globe. At the recent Investment Conference, which saw delegates from across the world convening at the Sandton Convention Centre in Johannesburg, Ramaphosa said that economic growth and job creation was central to the national agenda. During his opening speech at the conference, Ramaphosa said: “We are reprioritising our budget – within the existing fiscal framework – to invest more in those activities that will boost growth, including agriculture, township and rural businesses, and infrastructure.” Local and international businesses have pledged billions towards the country’s economic growth. For example, Mercedes-Benz had pledged R10 billion to invigorate the automobile sector. Ramaphosa will also speak about taxi and gang violence, cash-in-transit heists, community protests and other crimes across the country. This morning, Police Minister Bheki Cele provided an update regarding the latest statistics on cash-in-transit heists in the country. He said that 237 suspects had been arrested since April, and 70 firearms and 1 000 rounds of ammunition had been recovered. Ramaphosa is expected to outline government’s strategy to reduce the occurrence of heists, and to curb the proliferation of illegal firearms. The question and answer session begins at 2pm.
