Accounting student Sibongile Mani appeared briefly in the East London Magistrates’ Court on Monday where her case was to be heard by Magistrate Rochelle Sam. The Walter Sisulu University student‚ who accidentally received R14 million for food and book allowances from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) after an administrative error, allegedly spent more than R800 000 in three months last year before the anomaly was detected. Mani’s spending spree was said to have been on Peruvian weaves‚ alcohol and lavish parties. NSFAS blamed the university and its service provider for the error and ordered a forensic probe into the matter. The funds were paid back by Intellimali, which was contracted to manage student accounts. Mani, who attended WSU at the time, was charged with theft and subsequently arrested by the Hawks’ Serious Commercial Crime unit in May this year. The 28-year-old had been released on a warning prior to her appearance in court today. The Magistrate postponed the case to July 24 in order to allow Mani’s lawyer‚ Asanda Pakade‚ to get a copy of the charge sheet from the National Prosecuting Authority. - Additional reporting by DispatchLIVE
