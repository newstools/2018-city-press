Kabelo Matsepe, mentioned in the unfolding VBS scandal as the businessman who raised funds for the bank, the private sector and municipalities, has dismissed claims that a car accident over the weekend was an attempted hit on his life. Matsepe was admitted to hospital after the accident just outside Centurion in Tshwane on Sunday night when his car collided with another one. To his shock, said Matsepe, calls started coming in on Monday morning from as far as his home province in Limpopo. Relatives, people who knew him and journalists were enquiring about claims that the accident was linked to his testimony in the ongoing VBS forensic probe. “I only gave testimony during the investigations on matters relating to my company and the work I did for VBS and I don’t think anyone would feel threatened by the truth.” He said that if there was any “serious threat” he would have long been alerted through his “connections”. Matsepe said the “unsubstantiated rumours demonstrated why the investigation into VBS needed to be concluded swiftly”. City Press had reported that Matsepe had a written contract as an agent to raise capital for VBS and received R12 million in fees. According to a civil case heard before the Gauteng South High Court on Tuesday, at least R1.5 billion kept by depositors in VBS, including municipalities, was allegedly looted by the bank’s executives and their associates. Provisional sequestration orders were granted against three businessmen in the VBS Mutual Bank fraud saga and the banks main shareholder, Vele Investments, was also liquidated.
