More South Africans are unemployed now than in first quarter of 2018. The country’s unemployment rate increased to 27.2% in the second quarter, up by 0.5% percentage points from 26.7% in the first quarter. Part of the reason was that 102 000 people became unemployed in the second quarter. This is according to the quarterly labour workforce statistics, which Statistician-General Risenga Maluleke released on behalf of Statistics South Africa on Tuesday. Over the past 10 years, unemployment spiked, from 4.4. million in 2008 to 6.1 million in the second quarter of 2018. More worrying is the fact that 4.2 million people have remained unemployed for 12 months or longer.  When it came to statistics on youth unemployment, 67.1% of the 10.3 million people in the workforce aged 15 to 24 years were unemployed.  Within the working population group of people between 15 to 64 years – which includes a labour force of 22.3 million – 15.5 million people were not economically active. About 2.9 million of them were discouraged work seekers, or people who have not actively looked for a job.  Industries that saw the greatest loss in numbers were manufacturing, services and trade, with the manufacturing industry being the hardest hit, losing 105 000 employees. This included employees involved in the manufacturing of basic metals, food and beverages and tobacco products. The retail trade and motor vehicle repair industry also suffered a loss of 57 000 employees. Despite the ongoing strikes in the transport industry over the past few months, this has been the main driver of employment, with 54 000 more employees being added to the industry.  The construction and mining industry also saw gains, with 45 000 and 38 000 employees being added to the industries respectively for the second quarter of 2018. Black females remain the most vulnerable, with 33.2% of this group being unemployed for the second quarter, up from 32.6 % in the first quarter. 7.4% of white females were unemployed during the second quarter; also up from the previous quarter of 7.1%. Gauteng remains the province with the highest employment figures, employing more than 5 million of the country’s workforce.
