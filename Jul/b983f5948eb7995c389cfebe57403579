Flourish, a social franchise, is hosting an antenatal support programme for expecting mothers in Johannesburg city centre, Yeoville and Jeppestown. The classes are an attempt to prevent stunting in children before they are even born. The programme will feature 10 themed classes, with the first five being offered for free, and invites all mothers less than 26-weeks pregnant to attend. The programme highlights that from conception to the age two, babies are most vulnerable to stunting and aims to support, celebrate and empower mothers in this critical stage of the baby’s life. Research published by BMC Public Health noted that stunting persisted in democratic South Africa “at a significant level”. Khadija Richards, one of the facilitators of the programme, stressed the importance of mothers having support and the benefits of programmes such as these. “Mothers should attend these classes because research shows that clinical antenatal support, further supported by psychosocial interventions such as support groups, provides the best possible start for mum and baby. “Health messaging about nutrition, birth planning and supplementation among other things provided by the clinic nurses, are reinforced and mums have a rare opportunity to ask more questions they may feel there is no time for in the clinic visit,” said Richards. The classes will offer breathing, meditation and stretching exercises, baby growth monitoring and reflections on clinic visits in addition to the 10 themed classes. “Mothers in the Flourish programme are encouraged to build a community of support in their locality, which is proven to strengthen parenting and infant health outcomes,” she added. The sessions will take place on Tuesdays at Lapeng, and on Thursdays and Saturdays at Yeoville Library. More classes will be hosted in other parts of the city centre.
