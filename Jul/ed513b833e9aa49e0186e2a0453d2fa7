His niece, Ana Saunders, said that the family had been giving out flyers in Parkrand Boksburg and were hoping for the best. She said that they had finally found him at Johannesburg General Hospital.  “We were told that he was hit by a car and was transported to the hospital on July 5. He is in ICU, stable and alive,” said Saunders. “We are glad and relieved. The whole family is emotional. We thank God for keeping him safe.” Saunders said that the family was grateful to eveyone who offered to help find her uncle. She said her uncle was a good man who was loved by almost everyone. “He was a loved school principal – even the learners adored him. We didn’t think that he had any enemies,” said Saunders. “He lives alone, he does not have a wife or any kids, he would just go to the casino when he was bored,” she said. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi visited the school on Thursday to interact with the school population. “The MEC assured his support to the acting principal, management, educators and learners during this difficult period,” said the department’s spokeperson, Steven Mabona. “We are glad that the school is not disrupted and we will continue to monitor the school.”
