Emergency services are still on high alert because of heavy rains in Johannesburg over the past few days. Major floods caused a massive sinkhole in Centurion and knocked over trees in some residential areas. The City of Joburg said that roads all over the city had been affected as well as informal settlements. Three lanes on the M1 North were closed after a tree fell on the highway. Flooding was also reported on Leeuwkop and Rivonia roads. Severe flooding has also been reported on Witkoppen Road and Fourways Boulevard. It began on Thursday night and continued until Friday morning.  Motorists have been urged to refrain from crossing flooded roads and bridges and use alternative routes instead. “The City of Johannesburg’s Emergency Management Services will remain on high alert to make sure that we can be able to effectively respond to any emergency which might occur,” EMS spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi said. The South African Weather Service said that more than 50mm of rain was expected to fall in some areas. “Heavy rain leading to localised flooding is expected in the eastern parts of the Free State‚ in places in North West‚ Gauteng‚ Highveld areas of Mpumalanga and in places in KwaZulu-Natal,” the weather service said.
