Economic Freedom Fighters members have marched from the University of Johannesburg (UJ) to the Helen Joseph Hospital to deliver the memorandum demanding that health services in the province be improved. The march on Thursday was part of the party’s rolling mass action and awareness campaigns to highlight shortcomings in the public health system in the country. At the Helen Joseph Hospital, they handed over the memorandum to a senior management member, Dr Raymond Bila. Malesela Ledwada, the party’s Gauteng secretary, said reports of some patients being mistreated in public health institutions were cause for concern. He said the communities were tired of being treated without care which has been going on for several years now. He said the pickets and marches were planned to take place every month in different hospitals to raise public concerns about the treatment of patients. They will also visit the municipalities and metros to highlight their demands for decent public health services. “We want to encourage our communities to continue demanding their public public health rights be realised. We also want the government to take this matter seriously and act on our concerns,” said Ledwada.
