Many fought alongside him in pursuit of fee-free higher education but, on Friday, Fees Must Fall activist Mcebo Dlamini cut a lone figure as he made his 30th court appearance at the Johannesburg Magistrates’ Court. Dlamini who, alongside the likes of student activists Vuyani Mphambo, Nompendulo Mkhatshwa and Shaeera Kalla, led the #FeesMustFall movement from the University of the Witwatersrand. He finally got a trial date scheduled for July 30 and 31 for his role in the protests. The former University of Witwatersrand student representative council president is currently studying towards a postgraduate law degree at the University of the Witwatersrand. He was arrested in October 2016 and later released on R2 000 bail on November 9 in the Palm Ridge Magistrates’ Court. He was arrested on a number of charges, including violating a court order, public violence, assault, theft, and malicious damage to property. Dlamini was initially arrested after being photographed wearing a police riot gear helmet while carrying a rock and a shield allegedly belonging to a security guard at Wits main campus during the student protests in 2016. He has since been charged with violating a court order after the university obtained an interdict against protesting students. As a student studying law, Dlamini has on numerous occasions expressed concerns over being found guilty as this would mean he would not be able to practice law if he graduates. Dlamini will be considering Friday’s setting of trial dates a victory because he has appeared in court on numerous occasions without any sign of progression with regards to the case. Despite numerous attempts to contact Dlamini, he was unavailable for comment.
