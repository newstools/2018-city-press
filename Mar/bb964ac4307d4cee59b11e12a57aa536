The Chinese Lantern Festival traditionally marks the end of the Chinese new year festival. South Africans gathered at China Mall in Johannesburg to celebrate 20 years of China-South Africa diplomatic relations. Among the guests was Chinese ambassador to South Africa Lin Songtian. The Lantern Festival symbolizes the reunion of family for Chinese nationals. Celebrations included different activities such as face changing, drum performances and the Xinjiang Dance performance to name a few. The festival will continue until March 4 2018 at China Mall.
