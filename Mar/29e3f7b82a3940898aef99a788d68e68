Convicted racist and former estate agent Vicki Momberg has been sentenced to three years in prison, with one year suspended. The one-year suspension was on the basis that Momberg would not commit the crime again. The sentence was handed down on Wednesday morning at the Randburg Magistrates Court by magistrate Pravina Rugoonandan. She said the sentence was handed down as deterrence to anyone who used the k-word. Momberg, who was found guilty of four counts of crimen injuria after she was recorded on camera hurling racial insults at a black police officer and 10111 call centre agents who assisted her after being involved in a smash-and-grab in 2016, appeared to not be remorseful throughout the sentencing proceedings, Rugoonandan said. The video, which went viral, showed Momberg in a fit of rage degrading black people. She called them “clueless” and used the k-word a staggering 48 times. Momberg has previously testified that she felt intimidated by the social workers and authorities who were working on her case, and that the media had been painting an incorrect picture of who she is. Earlier this month when the social worker who handled her case testified, Takalani Sekoba said that Momberg had hurled racial slurs towards her as well. Sekoba said when she had interviewed Momberg, she told her that she did not like the way in which Sekoba spoke to her and eventually Sekoba asked to be removed from the case. The senior probation officer who oversaw Momberg’s case, Daphney Naidoo, told the court that Momberg’s treatment of Sekoba led Sekoba to undergo counselling. Last year, the Equality Court ordered Momberg to pay R100 000.
