Former Minister of Police Fikile Mbalula has resigned as a Member of Parliament. A statement released by the office of ANC Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu, says that Mbalula tendered his resignation on February 26. “While Comrade Mbalula’s departure from Parliament will leave a void, we derive satisfaction from the knowledge that he will continue serving the movement as the ANC’s head of elections towards the 2019 general elections campaign,” spokesperson Nonceba Mhlauli said. Mbalula was appointed as police minister on March 31 2017, following a sudden midnight Cabinet reshuffle by former President Jacob Zuma. Mbalula had taken over the position from Nathi Nhleko. The current position is held by Bheki Cele, who was appointed to the role by President Cyril Ramaphosa in a Cabinet reshuffle on February 26 this year. Cele previously held the position of national police commissioner, until he was suspended following allegations of corruption. Mbalula’s resignation follows hot on the heels of the resignation of Lynne Brown, who last week resigned as an ANC MP. She was previously the minister of public enterprises, a position now held by former finance minister Pravin Gordhan, who was also appointed to the position during Ramaphosa’s cabinet reshuffle.
