Nancefield Hostel in Soweto used to be one of the apartheid government’s labour dormitories. It gained the fearsome reputation of the brutal Noxus in the 90s due to the political violence between hostel dwellers and the surrounding township communities. Photographer Mpumelelo Buthelezi captured the mood and the evolved lifestyle inside this ageing hostel complex buildings now enclosed by informal settlements with an estimated population of 3000. It is now a home to many younger men and women born here after the advent of democracy in 1994 who have turned it into a vibrant and busy poverty-stricken residential complex boasting of one of the busiest shisanyama called Mutah which is famous for its chicken and pap menu and less filthy. Its younger generation plays and mixes with their peers across the neighbourhood. Michael Mthetwa is a traditional healer known as Bab’ Mnyambose who has been living here since 2000 with his 3 sons. He was born in KwaZulu-Natal. He says that they used to rent in these hostel rooms before. Today more man are living with their families. The government has long undertaken to change these hostels into family units instead, the community here has transformed the environment into the homely, tolerant and child-friendly complex.
