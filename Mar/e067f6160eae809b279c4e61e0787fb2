A sexual assault case has been opened against a forensic investigator who allegedly molested two children at AB Xuma Primary School in Soweto. The SA Police Service (SAPS) investigator is part of the team investigating sexual assault cases involving a scholar patrolman who is accused of sexually assaulting more than 80 pupils at the school. According to the Gauteng Department of Education, the incident occurred on March 12 2018, when the officer visited the victims at the school to prepare them for court appearances. The investigator is said to have sexually molested the two Grade 3 learners, aged seven and eight respectively, during this visit. “These allegations are shocking and disturbing. A person entrusted with protecting children has violated their trust and that of their parents. This man should meet the full might of the law,” Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said. The parents of the learners have opened sexual assault cases against the investigator and the matter has been escalated to Family and Child Services, who came to the school to interview the affected learners and their parents. “We are dismayed, saddened and disappointed that the two learners were also victims in the case currently before the court. That is, the case against the patroller. The children have now become victims of sexual assault twice by different people,” the department added in a statement. The officer has since been withdrawn from the case with immediate effect.
