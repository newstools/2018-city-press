David Beckham, football superstar, model and now scotch ambassador, has arrived in South Africa. Beckham, known for his fancy footwork as England captain and for plying his trade at some of the world’s biggest football clubs, is in the country to promote his partnership with scotch whisky maker Haig Club Clubman. At the launch of the “stand-out blue square bottle” on Wednesday evening, Beckham said that it was truly special to raise a glass of Haig Club Clubman. “I am incredibly proud to have been part of the creation of Haig Club and to be working with Diageo in South Africa,” Beckham said. Among Diageo’s collection of premium alcoholic brands, the distribution company boasts brands such as Jonnie Walker, J&B and Cîroc. Beckham told City Press that it was an easy fit to work with Diageo and that he was very excited to be part of the Haig campaign. “Partnering with someone that is the expert in many different areas is obviously what interested me,” the footballer, and soon to be football club owner, beamed. The launch event was attended by local actor Lungile Radu and fashion stylist Tshepi Vundla. Diageo’s global whisky master, Ewan Gunn, said that the scotch brand was versatile and one for all palettes. “Haig Club Clubman is a scotch crafted to appeal to people who are new to whisky, and whisky connoisseurs alike. Our signature serve, the clubman and cola, is a stunning drink, with the vanilla, butterscotch and sweet toffee flavours of the whisky combining perfectly with the sweet caramel of cola,” Gunn emphasised. The innovative, stand-out blue square bottle of Haig makes it a no-brainer that the company would partner with one of the world’s most recognisable faces. And with Beckham’s winning smile, the single grain scotch will leave you feeling a certain way. Look out for the full interview with football legend Beckham in City Press newspaper on Sunday.
