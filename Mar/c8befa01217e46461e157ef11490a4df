During today’s sentencing of convicted racist Vicki Momberg at the Randburg Magistrates’ Court, the report which was compiled by a probation officer painted a non-apologetic picture of the woman who has been publically shamed following her racist outburst in 2016. Momberg was found guilty of four counts of crimen injuria in November last year after a video emerged of her racially abusing a police officer by using the k-word, after she was victim to a smash and grab in Northriding, Johannesburg in February 2016. The video shows an angry Momberg hurl insults, using the k-word 48 times, and Momberg telling someone on the phone that “the k****** in Jo’burg are terrible, I’m so sick of it”. In the video, Momberg goes on to say that black people are “clueless”. The four counts were for calling the 10111 South African Police Services call centre and calling the person who answered the phone a “f*****g k****r”, for calling another call centre agent a “f*****g b*tch”, for calling the 10111 call centre agent a “useless k****r” and the last count was for calling Constable David Mkhondo, who assisted her at the scene of her smash and grab a “useless k****r” and “black bastard”. In June last year, she was ordered by the Equality Court to pay R100 000 in damages to Mkhondo, the racial insults she had hurled towards him that night. Today in court, a senior probation officer handling the case said that Momberg had found herself a victim of the court and the media as they were not “sympathetic” to her, and that she was refusing to take responsibility for her actions. The officer also found that Momberg wanted to appeal the ruling that the Equality Court handed down against her, forcing her to pay the R100 000. The officer also said that Momberg found the k-word, which she had used at length in the video, to not be insulting, that it was only insulting if a person believed it to be insulting. The sentencing continues on March 16.
