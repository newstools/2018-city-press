A living memory campaign for a new museum and archive for the Constitution at Constitution Hill in Johannesburg is kicking off this week – and we want to hear your part of the story that makes up the history of South Africa. This is the first in a series of short stories that City Press and Con Hill will share each week to help build the new Museum and Archive of the Constitution at the Hill, known as March. MMAGAUTA’S STORY Mmagauta Molefe, a former political prisoner at the Women’s Jail at Con Hill, shared her memory: “I was a courier for the resistance, which meant I had to take sensitive documents across the border to those in exile. "I used a dress with a very large hem and hid the letters and reports and other documents in the hem ... "When I was in detention I used the dress to smuggle out other prisoners’ notes and letters, which they had written on toilet paper…” WHAT’S YOUR STORY? By sharing your stories, you will help to record and preserve our nation’s history – and your family’s legacy – so that March will become a space owned by all South Africans. Do you have a story or objects (such as banning orders, passbooks, items of clothing, memorabilia) that tell the story of how apartheid laws affected you or your family’s life? If you would like to contribute, please send a photo of the object/s with your story and contact details to 35697 with the keyword MARCH or email us at projects@citypress.co.za. SMSes cost R1.50 each. You can also share your story on Twitter @City_Press or on City Press’ Facebook page using the hashtag #MARCHyourstory. The curators of the collection will get back to you once they have reviewed the submissions. . March will also host a public lecture by Lonnie Bunch on The Making of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture on March 21, Human Rights Day. An educator and historian, Bunch is the museum’s founding director. The lecture is free and takes place at Constitution Hill at 6pm on March 21.
