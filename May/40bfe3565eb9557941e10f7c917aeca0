An inquest has been opened after a burning body was discovered in a park near the University of Johannesburg, in Auckland Park on Tuesday morning. A man who spotted the body under a tree at about 8.30am, said he was still shocked. “I usually come to the park in the mornings to smoke ... and I realised a human’s body was burning,” he said. The man said he could not explain what had happened but the police and emergency services arrived hours later. The scene had been cordoned off by the time City Press arrived. There was speculation that the deceased was a homeless person but the police could not confirm this. Warrant Officer Thomas de Bruyn from the Sophiatown police station said: “We are still investigating the burnt unidentified body and we are opening an inquest docket.”
