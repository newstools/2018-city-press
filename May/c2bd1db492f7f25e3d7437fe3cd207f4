Sam Nzima, the photographer who took the iconic picture of a dying Hector Pieterson in 1976, died on Saturday at the age of 83. The Mpumalanga-born photographer collapsed on Thursday and was immediately rushed to Rob Ferreira Hospital in Neslpruit, where he was admitted, his first born son Thulani Nzima told City Press. He said that Nzima died at about 6pm on Saturday evening. He said that the family would most likely release a detailed statement on Sunday. “We understand that he was also a public figure and not just a family man, so we will be sharing information with the public as and when it becomes available,” he said. Nzima captured the picture of Mbuyisa Makhubu carrying Pieterson’s body as he and Antoinette Sithole ran from the police, who were indiscriminately shooting at schoolchildren who were protesting in Soweto against the Bantu education system on June 16 1976. Altogether, 575 people were killed that day.  It was also the day Nzima set his camera aside so that he would avoid persecution by security police, who were outraged at the impact that his photograph had on world opinion. Economic Freedom Fighters secretary-general Godrich Gardee tweeted that “the last click of liberation cameraman is no more”
