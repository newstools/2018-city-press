Unions and employers were back at the bargaining table on Thursday,but there was little in the way of positive outcomes. Entering its 16th day on Thursday, the national bus strike is set continue with employers standing firm on their original wage offer of an 8% increase in the first year and a 8.5% increase in the second year. Talks first broke down when employers gave the strikers an ultimatum last week that they should accept the 9% increase for the first year and a 8.5% in the second year, or else the 8% increase would be back on the table. Unions were seeking a 9.5% increase at the time of the ultimatum. The negotiations were facilitated by the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration, with the Bargaining Council also in attendance. The CCMA had proposed an 8% increase in the first year and 8.5% in the second year of a two-year agreement. Employers accepted the offer on the condition that the unions drop some of their other demands, such as payment for night shift & in-sourcing of workers. Unions initially demanded a 12% increase, but dropped their wage demand to 9.5% in the first year and 9% in the second year. South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu) spokesperson Zanele Sabela expressed her disappointment at the outcome of negotiations, saying that they were demoralising. “Employers have made good on their threat to revert back to the mediators proposal of 8% for the first year and 8.5% in the second year,” she said. “How do you keep negotiating with people who keep changing their story? It’s demoralising really. Now the unions are sitting together deciding on how to intensify the strike. Unfortunately, the strike continues,” she told eNCA. Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant and Transport Minister Blade Nzimande were not part of the negotiations, but have called for bus services to resume.
