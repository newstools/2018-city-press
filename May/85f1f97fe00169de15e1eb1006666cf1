Former North West education MEC OJ Tselapedi was hours away from replacing Supra Mahumapelo as North West premier when the ANC pulled the plug. City Press has seen a copy of the provincial gazette and the letter that acting North West ANC secretary Susan Dantjie sent to the electoral commission to request an amendment to the ANC list of MPLs. The amendment placed Tselapedi at number 24, which would have made him next in line if there was a vacancy in the ANC caucus. The ANC has 23 seats in the North West. ANC MPL Duma Ndleleni was suffering from ill-health and Tselapedi could take his place. Highly placed sources in the North West told City Press on Thursday that the swearing-in of Tselapadi had already been prepared but the plans were later abandoned. Tselapedi also had Mahumapeloâ€™s support. The ANC in the province later blocked Mahumapelo from resigning and he instead took a leave of absence. As his final act he appointed finance MEC Wendy Nelson to act as premier.

Molefe later returned to Eskom.
