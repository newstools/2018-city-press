Public hearings into whether or not Section 25 of the Constitution should be amended – for the purpose of expropriating land without compensation – will be held in all nine provinces commencing on June 26, Parliament has confirmed. The Constitutional Review Committee, which is looking into this matter and will submit its proposal to the National Assembly, will be split into two teams with one taking the inland provinces while the other tackles the coastal provinces. Speaking to City Press on Tuesday afternoon, co-chair of the committee Lewis Nzimande said that he and fellow chair Vincent Smith will lead the teams with Smith taking the responsibility for the inland teams while he takes charge of the coastal teams. Although names of parliamentarians have not been finalised, Nzimande said that Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema is expected to be part of the inland team while his deputy Floyd Shivambu will be part of the coastal delegation. Democratic Alliance MP Thandeka Mbabama, African Christian Democratic Party MP Steve Swart and National Freedom Party MP Sibusiso Mncwabe have indicated that they would like to be part of the coastal teams. “The intention is to assist those who are not able to make any written submissions and those who might not be able to come to Cape Town for the hearings,” said Nzimande on the need to have these public consultations. Hearings are expected to start at 10am and will run until 4pm, depending on the number of people in attendance. Nzimande said that the public hearings are an extension of the formal hearings in Parliament, but the aim here is to listen to what the people on the ground want, adding that those citizens will be the ones doing most of the talking while the MPs listen. “They will stand in their queues and raise their hands and oral presentations will then be made. If there are any written notes this will be submitted to the secretariat there.” Nzimande also said teams from Parliament’s Democracy Development Program were already on the ground in local venues identified by the committee in an effort to help educate people about the process and structure of these hearings so that they are effective. Transport arrangements to the scheduled venues will be provided for those from far-flung areas. Asked if MPs won’t put impose their views on those who will be taking part in the public hearings, Nzimande said that he is confident that “this is a genuine and an honest consultation with the public.” “There are rules. The members of Parliament understand the rules and that until the committee considers a matter formally, members of the committee do not have the right to influence the floor. Members must understand that in a public hearing your views must be restrained. When there is a formal sitting of the committee again, then the members’ views will be welcomed.” Nzimande also confirmed that the committee submitted a request to the National Assembly’s presiding officers to ask for an extension until September 12. This was made due to 140 000 written submissions already in the hands of the committee and with more expected after the deadline was extended to June 15. The committee is expected to conclude public hearings on August 4 when both teams will meet for one final session in Cape Town.
