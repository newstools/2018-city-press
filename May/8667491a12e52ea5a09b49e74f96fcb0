The SABC has defended Metro FM deejay Masechaba Ndlovu following a backlash on social media from listeners over her controversial interview with gqom queen Babes Wodumo. Ndlovu and co-host Mo Flava revealed details of Wodumo’s alleged abuse by former boyfriend Mandla Maphumulo during The Drive show on Friday afternoon. During the interview, Ndlovu confronted the Wololo hit artist with the allegations, and Wodumo did not deny claims that she was once punched in the face by Maphumulo and that he broke her leg. Asked by Mo Flava what she would do next, Wodumo responded: “I don’t know. I always say that there’s no point in seeking revenge. So I have this thing that God will fight for me and He fights for me and will fight for me.” Some listeners complained that Ndlovu had pushed Wodumo about a sensitive personal subject. Others called it sabotage and said it was unfair that Maphumulo did not face questions about his conduct. SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago said: “There’s nothing new to what they said. I’ve read about [Wodumo’s abuse] in newspapers. As an organisation, we will seriously deal with those issues that are in the public space whether they implicate well-known people or not.” He said the SABC would respond if any complaints were laid with the Broadcasting Complaints Commission. Maphumulo yesterday posted on his Facebook page that he “was no saint”, nor was he pleading “absolute innocence in the claims made in that interview” and that he “may have reacted in a couple of incidents” over certain things during their relationship. However, he said he was not comfortable discussing those issues in public. He apologised to South Africans for their disappointment in him and said: “No man has any right or justification to abuse a woman in any form whatsoever.”
