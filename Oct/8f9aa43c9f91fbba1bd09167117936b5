The Black Management Forum has elected its former Western Cape chairperson Andile Nomlala as its new president. Nomlala was elected during the organisation’s annual general meeting held at Gallagher Estate on Friday alongside Tasneem Frederik as the deputy president. Both positions were uncontested and the new leaders take over from president and deputy Mncane Mthunzi and Dumisani Mpafa. Speaking to City Press shortly after being elected, Nomlala said the primary focus of his leadership collective would be to prioritise transformation. “Our primary focus is transformation. We can no longer be spectators. I am not saying we are sidelined because we cannot be sidelined if we have never knocked on any doors. We are ready to be part of the new dawn,” Nomlala said. Nomlala said both the government and the private sector would be kept accountable under his leadership and that The organisation’s journey to the elections has not been a smooth one with a recently commissioned report indicating that the Western Cape branch’s membership have been inflated through using sponsorship money to pay individual membership fees, an issue that was subsequently uncovered by City Press and confirmed by some of the major sponsors.
