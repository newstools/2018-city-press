This week’s announcement by the SA Football Association (Safa) that yesterday’s Africa Cup of Nations qualifier between Bafana Bafana and the Seychelles, “as well as international matches for Banyana Banyana, will not be broadcast on any of the SABC platforms” was a shocker! Not because it was unexpected and came out of the blue, but because it’s a sign that the two organisations do not take the public seriously. The last Bafana game against Libya was only beamed live on television and SABC radio stations after the intervention of both Sports Minister Tokozile Xasa and Communications Minister Nomvula Mokonyane. That the two organisations cannot resolve their issues without an intervention from government is a serious indictment on the leadership of Safa and the SABC. The same scenario played itself out at the beginning of this Premier Soccer League season. The two ministers had to act swiftly as well at that time for fans to be able to follow their favourite game on radio. That the SABC is a common denominator on both occasions says a lot about its leadership, or the quality thereof, at Dithering Heights. Safa in its statement noted that the state broadcaster had recently signed two contracts to show Premier League matches, as well as one with Cricket SA to broadcast T20 league games. Football is the biggest sport locally and globally. This impasse, which does not only affect Bafana and Banyana but junior teams as well, must be resolved as soon as possible. Safa and the SABC need to put the millions of football followers ahead of their personal interests and petty politics, and show leadership. Maybe government must also loosen the stringent rules they have put in place as a condition for football as a sport of national interest, rules which do not seem to apply with rugby and cricket. The time has come for football to stop being treated as the poor cousin of the two other big sports.
