City Press has learnt that hours after its release on Wednesday, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) allocated six senior officials from the unit the task of studying Motau’s report.

"This process is independent of the criminal investigation and the purpose is to preserve the assets while the investigation continues,” said one prosecutor privy to the details. The prosecutor said once that process was completed, the NPA would launch court applications for preservation orders.

The onus is on the accused to prove that the assets were acquired through legitimate means,” said another prosecutor. NPA spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku declined to comment, but confirmed a team “made up of prosecutors, financial investigators and asset forfeiture specialist lawyers” was appointed on Wednesday. Mfaku said Hawks detectives investigating the looting at VBS Mutual Bank were being led by Marijke de Kock, deputy head of the Pretoria SCCU, with four other prosecutors providing prosecutorial guidance. The AFU’s investigation was led by regional heads Priya Biseswar and Chris Ndzengu, assisted by the NPA’s chief financial investigator, JP Willemse. “We have also appointed asset forfeiture specialist lawyers to assist the team studying the report,” Mfaku said.
