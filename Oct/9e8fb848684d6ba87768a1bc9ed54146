The death of former apartheid-era minister of foreign affairs Pik Botha has been met with mixed reactions from South Africans. Tributes have started to pour in following his death, with United Democratic Movement leader Bantu Holomisa acknowledging Botha’s role in fighting for a better South Africa.  Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom has hailed his great intellect and sense of humour. He said in a Tweet that he was saddened by the passing. “I spent two years sitting next to him in the first cabinet of our new democracy, under President Nelson Mandela. I wish I kept all the scribbled notes he passed on to me. Great intellect, great sense of humour,” he said  Botha died on Thursday night at the age of 86. He was admitted to a Pretoria hospital last month following health complications. Botha was a stalwart of the National Party and a staunch defender of the apartheid cause at the United Nations and around the world, where he denounced the ANC leadership as "terrorists". However, he later joined the ANC in 2000. In April 1977, he was appointed minister of foreign affairs and he also served as minister of energy affairs in 1994 under former President Nelson Mandela’s administration. He resigned in 1996. Born 27 April 1932 in Rustenburg, he completed his BA LLB at the University of Pretoria and in February 1953, he joined the South African department of foreign affairs.
