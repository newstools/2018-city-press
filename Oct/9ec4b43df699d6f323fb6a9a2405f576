MTN eSwatini chief executive officer Ambrose Mandvulo Dlamini was yesterday appointed as the new prime minister of the Kingdom of eSwatini. His appointment came after a week of speculation about who would fill the position. On Wednesday, King Mswati III asked his subjects to help him identify a candidate who could help the country revive its ailing economy. Yesterday, throngs of emaSwati went to the Ludzidzini Royal Residence Cattle Byre, where they waited patiently in the scorching heat for the king to break the news. When the king entered the area at about 3pm, those in attendance hoped that the moment had arrived. Instead, the king ordered them to continue to make the submissions in his presence. Just before 3.40pm, the people were told to stop and the king was ready to speak to them. “I have heard your contributions and ideas, so I think you will continue to assist the man that the king will give you as prime minister as he executes his duties. I am grateful that your prayers and consultation with ancestral spirits has made my work easy to identify Mandvulo Dlamini as your next prime minister,” he said. Dlamini seemed surprised by the announcement. Before joining MTN, he was the chief executive officer at Nedbank Swaziland.
