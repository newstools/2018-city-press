The Basic Education Department has distanced itself from a letter making reference to a mathematics question paper. In the fake letter, with the heading “Notice of illegal distribution of matric final examinations”, the writer claims a mathematics question has been leaked. The department said this information is false. “While the so-called circular has our logo, it has no address, contact details or the name of the author. It is clearly designed to cause confusion. “We view this misleading communication in a very serious light, as it has the real potential of causing confusion and anxiety among our Grade 12 learners presently writing their examinations,” the department said on Monday. It urged parents, teachers, pupils and department officials to ignore the fake letter and stay focused on the job at hand. “We call upon our learners and teachers alike to continue to demonstrate commitment and good conduct as the examinations continue.” According to the department, the examinations are proceeding well across the country and no question paper has been leaked nor has there been a circular issued regarding any re-writing of any papers. There are no supplementary examinations in 2019; however, there is a full exam in May and in June 2019, the department said. The department said all nine provinces are monitoring the examinations on a constant basis to ensure that all goes well. – SAnews.gov.za
