Yesterday afternoon City Press online put out a tweet about social media’s responses to the passing of apartheid-era foreign affairs minister Pik Botha. Among those responses were high profile figures praising Botha for what they believe were his attempts to convince apartheid leaders to ease up on the evil of separate development. READ: Pik Botha through the ages: His life in pictures Although not reflected in the actual content of the story, our tweet described Botha as a “champion for the anti-apartheid cause”. We regret using this phrase, which is not accurate. Botha was at the heart of the apartheid government and was at the forefront of defending apartheid policies for decades, especially in the international arena. We certainly do not believe he was a champion of human rights. We deeply regret the error and we have deleted the tweet. We have also updated the story to properly reflect Botha’s role in the oppressive and evil system of apartheid.
