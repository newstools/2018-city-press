As Akani Simbine heads into tonight’s Diamond League as South African lone ranger at the Brussels final, the sprinter will have a special fan on the grandstands at the AG Van Damme Memorial meeting. Freshly minted Diamond champion Luvo Manyonga flew out of Switzerland to cheer up his compatriot after the long jumper led seven other South Africans at the Zürich final on Thursday. “It’s a fantastic feeling that a sizable South African team made the Diamond finals,” Manyonga told City Press after he edged out countryman Ruswahl Samaai for the Diamond Trophy. “You can take this whole team to the World Championships and bring back the medals. We’re capable of taking on the world next year. “I’m going to support Akani in Brussels, just to give my brother some love,” added Manyonga. It has been a long season for the reigning world champion, who again dominated the long jump this year with massive leaps over the 8.40m mark, that included two 8.58m in the Diamond qualifying meetings. The 27-year-old will close his season at the IAAF World Challenge meeting in Zagreb, Croatia, on Tuesday. Meanwhile Simbine will contest the 100m final in Brussels, in a quality line up that has Jamaica’s Yohan Blake who has already lost twice to the South African record holder in major completion this year. • Watch the IAAF Diamond League in Brussels on SS8 at 7.55pm and SS6 at 8pm.
