Parliament has postponed the meeting that was supposed to deliberate on Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s reply to the call on the Speaker to institute proceedings to remove her from office. The portfolio committee on justice and correctional services received Mkhwebane’s written reply on why she should not be removed from office at 11pm on Tuesday evening. The portfolio committee postponed this meeting to have more time to reflect on the Public Protector’s reply. In her reply, Mkhwebane said she had been met with hostility by some members of the portfolio committee. DA chief whip John Steenhuisen called for an investigation into the Mkhwebane’s suitability to hold office and wrote to the Speaker of the National Assembly. This matter was referred to the portfolio committee on justice and correctional services. Steenhuisen alleged that Mkhwebane had showed “ignorance for the law” in the Absa bank and Vrede Dairy Project matters. He said Mkhwebane’s reply to the portfolio committee was “completely disingenuous” and argued her response only addressed the personal cost ruling and not the rest of the accusations against her. Steenhuisen was adamant that the committee needed to institute an investigation into whether Mkhwebane was fit to hold the position of Public Protector but was uncertain of the likelihood of an inquiry happening. “The committee appears to be divided on the matter,” he said. The portfolio committee will deliberate the written reply of the Public Protector on August 29. Mkhwebane was not required to be present at the meeting with the committee on Wednesday but last month she failed to show up in Parliament to address this issue, citing a family emergency.
