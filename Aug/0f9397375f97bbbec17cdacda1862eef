Following a gruelling three weeks, wherein numerous candidates raised their hands for the presidency of the Black Business Council (BBC), the organisation has finally elected Sandile Zungu to be its leader. Zungu beat Gilbert Mosena after Thandi Ndlovu withdrew during the elective conference in Midrand on Tuesday night. Zungu managed 24 votes while Mosena received 17 votes. READ: Manoeuvring increases ahead of vote for BBC president Keith Thabo was elected vice-president for business ahead of Steve Skhosana, while the new vice-president for professionals is Nkuli Bogopa, who beat Dumisani Mpafa for the seat. The new treasurer is Bonolo Ramokhele who was handed the position on a silver platter after Dupree Vilakazi withdrew from the contest. Outgoing national office bearers George Sebulela and Sindi Mzamo got 13 and three votes, respectively, as Judy Nokwedi pipped them with 24 votes to take up the position as the organisation’s secretary. The new head of policy is Tilson Manyoni, who ran uncontested. Bridgette Radebe, who was not present at the conference, was elected ahead of Churchill Mrasi as the BBC’s chairperson with 25 votes. The conference, which went on till late in the evening, also saw the National African Federated Chamber of Commerce and Industry show its influence despite their own leadership woes. The organisation rallied behind most of the unsuccessful candidates which saw each of their chosen candidates receive at least 13 votes each. Earlier that day, another slate, allegedly concocted to confuse the opposition slate, was circulated with some of the candidates – who City Press spoke to – not even aware that their names were put forward.  • Chairperson: Bridgette Radebe • President: Sandile Zungu • Vice-president (professionals): Nkuli Bogopa • Vice-president (organised business): Keith Thabo • Secretary-general: Judy Nokwedi • Treasure-general: Bonolo Ramokhele • Head of policy: Tilson Manyoni
