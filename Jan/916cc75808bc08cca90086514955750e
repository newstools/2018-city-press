Mandla Mandela has welcomed a decision by the Supreme Court of Appeals (SCA) in Bloemfontein to dismiss Winnie Madikizela-Mandela’s claim of the Qunu property - which belonged to her late ex-husband, Nelson Mandela. This was after Madikizela-Mandela had approached the SCA to appeal a decision by the Mthatha High Court which dismissed her application to acquire the Qunu property.

We believe that this outcome respects the last wishes of uNkosi Dalibhunga [Mandela’s praise name] and is in accordance with his last will and testament as executed by the administrators of his estate and his family led by his wife Mamu Graca Machel and the Royal House of Mandela Chieftainship under my leadership. We are pleased to close this chapter of this saga and trust that it finally puts this matter to rest,” Mandla said.
