Several protestors have been arrested for allegedly petrol bombing a police vehicle outside HoÃ«rskool Overvaal in Vereeniging this afternoon. Gauteng police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said the suspects were being processed at the nearest police station. Dlamini said police would continue to monitor the situation at the school amid plans by protestors to continue with their demonstrations outside the school premises. The protests started after the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria set aside the decision by the Gauteng department of education to admit 55 English speaking pupils to the Afrikaans school. Police fired rubber bullets around 2pm to disperse the crowd after smoke was spotted emanating from the petrol bombed police van. The situation has been volatile at the school since the early hours today. Those protesting were members of the ANC Youth League, Congress of South African Students, National Association of School Governing Bodies and Overvaal Transformation Commitee (OTC). One of the protesters told City Press that among those arrested was a taxi driver who came to fetch pupils at the school. Another protestor blamed criminal elements for the incident. OTC chairperson Tlhoriso Mofokeng said protests would continue tomorrow morning.
