Demonstrations turned violent outside Hoërskool Overvaal on Thursday after a petrol bomb was thrown at a police van, which led to police making mass arrests. Members of the ANC, the Economic Freedom Fighters and parents protested for a second day outside the school, in anger over the High Court’s ruling this week that the Gauteng education department acted unlawfully when it ordered the school to admit 55 English speaking learners. Quarrels between protesters and the police broke out because protesters refused to remove their cars from the road, they insisted that “this is the only non-violent way to barricade the road leading to the school”. Photojournalist Rosetta Msimango was there and captured these images.
