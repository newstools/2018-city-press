Gauteng’s suspended head of health, who approved the transfer of Life Esidimeni patients to unregistered non-governmental organisations, has resigned. Gauteng health spokesperson Lesemang Matuka confirmed to News24 that Dr Barney Selebano submitted his resignation letter on Monday. In December, Selebano testified at the Life Esidimeni arbitration hearings, where he apologised for his role in the death of more than 140 mentally ill patients. Prior to the hearings, Selebano had said there was nothing he could have done to stop the transfer of patients to the unlicensed organisations. He urgently lodged an application in the South Gauteng High Court to set aside a subpoena instructing him to testify at the hearings, but failed to have the subpoena overturned. In his testimony, Selebano said his department was always under financial pressure and costs were always the biggest challenge for any head of department in the country.

Parliamentary chairperson of the select committee on social services, Cathy Dlamini, issued a statement this afternoon welcoming Selebano’s resignation. “Despite the resignation, the call the committee made for accountability against those responsible for the Esidimeni tragedy remains. “All necessary disciplinary and legal processes must continue and reach their natural conclusion,” Dlamini said. “It is concerning though that the internal disciplinary case against Selebano had yet not been concluded despite his suspension in February last year. “This has been a long standing challenge within the public service and must be addressed urgently,” Dlamini said.
