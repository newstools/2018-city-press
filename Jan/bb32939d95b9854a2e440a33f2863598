The sentencing of racist estate agent Vicki Momberg has been postponed to March 9. Momberg (48) appeared briefly at the Randburg Magistrates’ Court on Friday where she was expected to put forward arguments on why the court should show her mercy. The court postponed the sentencing due to Momberg’s probation report not being ready for submission. Momberg was found guilty on four counts of crimen injuria in November last year for hurling racial slurs at black police officers. A video went viral on social media showing her insulting Constable David Mkhondo who was trying to help her after an alleged smash-and-grab incident in Northriding, Johannesburg, in February 2016. She maintained that she was angry after being a victim of crime and didn’t recall using the k-word in her rant. Magistrate Pravina Rugoonandan ruled that the words used by Momberg were racial and intentional. She also said Momberg knew her actions were unlawful.
